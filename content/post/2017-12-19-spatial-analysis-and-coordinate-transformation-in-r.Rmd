I come to these situations where I have to work with spatial datasets frequently. 
Sometimes the datasets is in lat-long format and sometimes on `UTM` (Universal 
transverse Mercator) coordinate or 
`state plane coordinate system`. 

I extensively use `EFDC` (Environmental Fluid
Dynamic Code) model to do environmental modeling and have to convert the data 
into UTM coordinate system. I had used CORPSCON in the past but as an R enthusiast
I wanted to dig deeper in R and finad a way to do the transformation in R environment. 
Thankfully, I figured out that if we use the packages `sp`, `rgdal`, and `raster`, we 
can be able to convert the dataset (tiff or any x, y, z file) into 
lat-long / eastings-northings format. 


# Data download 

To demonstrate the spatial transformation feature, we will be using the Lake Victoria 
dataset. Let's go ahead and download lake victoria bathymetry data from `Harvard` using 
this [link](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml;jsessionid=11d6e23005e3e8e991b3dca35921?fileId=3074951&version=RELEASED&version=.0)

I have saved tehe data as `LV_Bathy_V6_1.tif` and the size of the file is `48.9 MB`.
If you want to download the data with R uncomment the first couple lines in the 
code below. 

Please install the packages if you don't have these packages in your machine. 
You can use `install.packages(c("raster", "sp", "rgdal"))` to bulk download the 
packages. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE, comment = ""}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(raster)
library(sp)
library(rgdal)
#download.file(url = "https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/3074951", 
#              destfile = "../../data/spatial_analysis/LV_Bathy_V6_1.tif")

filepath <- "../../data/spatial_analysis/LV_Bathy_V6_1.tif"
victoria <- raster(filepath)

```

Now that we have read the file in a raster `victoria`, let's plot and see how the 
bathymetry looks like. 

```{r}
plot(victoria)
```

In the above figure, you can see that the deeper portion of the lake has dark 
green shade and the shallow region has grey color contours. 

## Convert raster to points 

The raster dataset can be converted to `SpatialPointsDataFrame` using the 
`rasterToPoints` function in `raster` package. 

```{r}
victoria.pts <- raster::rasterToPoints(x = victoria, spatial = TRUE)
victoria.pts
```

### Change projection to geographic coordinate system

The projection of the new dataset is `lcc` i.e, Projected Coordinate System: Africa Lambert Conformal Conic. Now, let's 
go ahead and convert it to geographic coordinate system.

```{r}
geo.prj <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0"
victoria.pts <- spTransform(victoria.pts, CRS(geo.prj))
victoria.pts
```

```{r}
head(coordinates(victoria.pts))
```


### Create x, y, z dataframe

Now let's create x, y and z dataframe from the transformed data `victoria.pts`. The 
first column of `victoria.pts` is longitude and second column in latitude. 

```{r}
victoria.pts@data <- data.frame(victoria.pts@data, long = coordinates(victoria.pts)[,1], 
                                lat = coordinates(victoria.pts)[,2])
# View head of the dataset
head(victoria.pts@data)
dim(victoria.pts@data)
```

Let's look at the structure of the dataframe.

```{r}
str(victoria.pts@data)
```

If we want to convert lat long to UTM for lake victoria, we can use the following 
projection 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
utm.prj <- "+proj=utm +zone=16 ellps=WGS84"
```

One important thing to remember is that when you are specifying the options for 
the projection, don't use any spacing. For example if you use the following the 
program / transformation would throw as error. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Bad example
utm.prj <- "+proj = utm +zone = 16 ellps = WGS84"
```
