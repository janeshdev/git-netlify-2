In this post, we will look into how we can use text manipulation and using regular expression to do text manipulation. 

Some of the common text tasks in python are as follows:

* Removing some text from the series or a list 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(reticulate)
# use_python("/anaconda3/bin/python.app")
use_python("/anaconda3/bin/python", required = TRUE)
use_condaenv("base", conda = "/anaconda3/bin/conda")
```

```{python}
test = [1, 2, 'hello']
print(test[0])
```

```{r}
x <- c(12,2, 3, 4)
print(x)
```
