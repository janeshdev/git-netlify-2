I am a water resources / environmental engineer currently working in Dynamic Solutions International LLC in Edmonds, WA. I completed my PhD from Auburn University in 2014 and completed masters in Civil Engineering (MCE) from Auburn University in Summer 2012. During my PhD in Auburn, I worked on number of projects that required **numerical modeling, data analysis, data munging, data visualization and machine learning**. 

I am a passionate scientist who loves explaining data science / data visualization to non-technical business audiences.
