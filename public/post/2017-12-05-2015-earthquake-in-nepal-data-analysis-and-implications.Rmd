In this blogpost, I am going to take the earthquake data from April 2015 to 
May 2016 throughout the World. Then we will process the data in usable form and 
look at the data on Nepal. Later, we will also dive into the casualties from this 
devastating earthquake. We will look at how many people died, got injured from 
which district, using ggplot2, wordcloud and leaflet package. 

Let's get going.

First let's load the libraries that we will be using. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)
library(wordcloud)
library(visdat)
library(scales)
library(knitr)
```

We will be using the data from Asheshwor's github repository https://github.com/asheshwor/np-quake 
The file we will be using is `all_month_merged.csv`. I have downloaded the csv 
file and saved into my `data` folder. Now let's read the data. 

```{r}
# Analyzing Nepal earthquake data 
all_month <- read.csv(file = "../../data/earthquake/all_month_merged.csv", 
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(all_month)
```

Let's visualize our unprocessed data using `visdat` package: 

```{r}

visdat::vis_dat(all_month, palette = "qual", sort_type = FALSE, warn_large_data = FALSE)
```

It is a really nice way to see our variables and observations in a graphical form. 
We can see that variables `nst`, `gap`, and `dmin` have a lot of missing data. 

Let's look at head of the dataset:
```{r}
head(all_month)
```
We can see that our `time` column in not is `data` or `POSIXct` format. Let's go 
a head and fix that date format and add couple variables `year` and `month`. 

```{r}
all_month <- all_month %>% 
  # Add a new column named date
  mutate(date = gsub(time, pattern = "T", replacement = " ") %>% 
           gsub(., pattern = ".[0-9]+Z", replacement = "") %>% 
           ymd_hms(.))

# Examine head with new variables
all_month %>% select(time, latitude,longitude, place, date) %>% head()
```
Next thing we are going to fix is the place column. In this column, the text before 
comma is the information about the place and text after comma is the information 
about country / state. Let's us now separate this string into two columns. 

```{r}
all_month$country <- 
  as.character(lapply(1:nrow(all_month), 
                      FUN = function(x) 
                        tail(strsplit(all_month$place[x], 
                                      split = ",")[[1]],n=1L)))

# Remove all the white spaces from column country
all_month$country <- gsub("[[:space:]]", "", x = all_month$country)
```
I also remove the starting and trailing spaces on my `country` column. 

Let's examine our data frame again with few columns. The reason I am taking only 
few columns to display is to save some space. 

```{r}
all_month %>% select(date, latitude, longitude, country) %>% head()
# Total number of unique countries
length(unique(all_month$country))
```
There are data of 286 countries. 

We will now add `day`, and `month` columns to `all_month` dataframe.

```{r}

# Add month, day, and julian 
all_month <- all_month %>% 
  mutate(day = day(date), 
         month = month(date), 
         julian = julian(date, origin = ymd("2015-01-01")) %>% 
           floor() %>% as.numeric())
```

# Create a dataframe for country Nepal by using `dplyr` function `filter`

```{r}
# Now filter for the country Nepal
nepal_data <- all_month %>% dplyr::filter(country == "Nepal")
head(nepal_data)
```
Let's quickly plot the latitude,longitude and magnitude using ggplot:

```{r}
ggplot(nepal_data) + geom_point(aes(longitude, latitude, color = mag)) + 
  scale_color_continuous(low = "red", high = "blue")
```

The devastating earthquake occurred on 2015-04-25 in Nepal. So, let's examine 
the earthquake for that particular day. 

```{r}
# Total number of earthquakes on April 25th 
nepal_data %>% dplyr::filter(date > as.POSIXct("2015-04-24 23:59:59", tz = "UTC"), 
                             date < as.POSIXct("2015-04-26 00:00:00", tz = "UTC")) %>% 
  select(date, mag, place) %>%
  summary() %>% knitr::kable()
```

Earthquake actually occurred 33 times and the magnitude of earthquake varied from 
4.2 to 7.8 richter. The energy released from earthquake has a exponential relationship 
with the magnitude. Let's look at the image below from the Geological Society of America, 
of earthquake magnitudes and the equivalent energy release.

## Boxplot from April 25th to April 30th, 2015

Let's plot the boxplot for days from April 25th to April 30th. 

```{r}
nepal_data %>% 
  dplyr::filter(date > as.POSIXct("2015-04-1 00:00:00", tz = "UTC"), 
                date < as.POSIXct("2015-04-30 23:59:00", tz = "UTC")) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(date, mag, group = day)) 
```

## Visualizing the locations on the map using leaflet package 

We will now look into the leaflet package and plot the exact locations using 
latitude, longitude and magnitude of the earthquake. 

```{r}
nepal_data2 <- nepal_data %>% 
  dplyr::filter(date > as.POSIXct("2015-04-24 23:59:59", tz = "UTC"), 
                date < as.POSIXct("2015-04-26 00:00:00", tz = "UTC"))

# Following two lines of code were borrowed from Asheshwor's np-quake repository
nepal_data2$size <- cut(nepal_data2$mag, 
                        c(2, 3.9, 4.9, 5.9, 6.9, 7.9), 
                        labels = c("3.3 to 3.9", ">3.9 to 4.9", ">4.9 to 5.9", ">5.9 to 6.9", ">6.9 to 7.9" ))

pallet <- colorFactor(c("gray32", "dodgerblue4",  "slateblue4", "purple", "firebrick1"),
                      domain = c("3.3 to 3.9", ">3.9 to 4.9", ">4.9 to 5.9", ">5.9 to 6.9", ">6.9 to 7.9"))

library(leaflet)
#pal <- colorQuantile(palette = "YlOrRd", domain = nepal_data2$mag)

m <- leaflet(options = leafletOptions(miniZoom =8, maxZoom = 8), 
             #width = "100%", 
             data = nepal_data2) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  leaflet::addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                            lat = ~latitude, 
                            stroke = FALSE, 
                            fillOpacity = 0.8,
                            fillColor = ~pallet(size),
                            label = paste("mag=", nepal_data2$mag,
                                          "\n", "location = ",
                                          nepal_data2$place)
                            ) %>% 
        addLegend(
        "bottomleft", pal = pallet,
        values = sort(nepal_data2$size),
        title = "Magnitude"
        # labFormat = labelFormat()
      )
m
```

### Monthwise box plot of earthquake magnitude

```{r}
give.n <- function(x){
  return(c(y = mean(x), label = length(x)))
}

# Nepal monthwise box plot
nepal_data %>% 
  dplyr::filter(date > ymd_hms("2015-01-01 00:00:00"), 
                  date < ymd_hms("2016-01-01 00:00:00")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cut(date, breaks="month"), mag)) + geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun.data = give.n, geom = "text", hjust = -0.5, color = "blue") + 
  xlab("Date") + ylab("Magnitude")
```

Note that I have used `give.n` function to print the total number of earthquake 
occurrences each month. Note that the dataset has the data only from April 25. So 
the acutal number of total occurrences for the month of April 2015 would be 
higher. **This 7.8 richter earthquake caused the death of around 9000 people. **

# Casualies by Earthquake

Nepal government has made a spreadsheet available that has recorded the casualties 
by district. The data can be accessed on this [page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MCsMtcfN8jwGg4qdzYZCKyxpYp8cdqRSrEpF1WpR6ZE/edit#gid=1367273225)

The name of the spreadsheet is `Key Government Figures - Nepal Earthquake - 2015.xlsx` 
and we will be using `05-June-2015` sheet. 

In order to bring this google sheet package into R, we will use the fantastic 
`googlesheets` package by Jenny Bryan. Let's bring the data into the R environment.
I have saved the googlesheet to my google drive and the name of the sheet on my 
drive is `JD_Key Government Figures - Nepal Earthquake - 2015.xlsx`

```{r}
# Use library googlesheets to read Nepal earthquake data
# library(googlesheets)
# 
# # Authenticate googlesheets
# googlesheets::gs_auth()
# 
# fatal <- gs_title(x = "JD_Key Government Figures - Nepal Earthquake - 2015.xlsx")
# fatalities <- googlesheets::gs_read(ss = fatal, ws = "05-June-2015")
library(readxl)
fatalities <- readxl::read_excel(path = "../../data/earthquake/JD_Key Government Figures - Nepal Earthquake - 2015.xlsx",sheet = "05-June-2015")
```

We have to use the function `gs_auth()` first in order to aunthenticate the access 
to our google drive account. Then we can find the googlesheet with the function 
`gs_title`. After you have brought the googlesheet in R environment, use the function 
`gs_read` to read that sheet in a dataframe. 

Let's examine the data structure again using the `visdat` package. 

```{r}
# Use visdat to visualize the type of data in a dataframe
visdat::vis_dat(fatalities, palette = "qual", sort_type = FALSE)
visdat::vis_miss(fatalities)
```

## Total number of fatalities by District

In Nepal, there are 75 districts. All the data provided by the goverment is by 
district. We can visualize how many people died, how many got injured, how many 
public and government buildings were damaged by earthquake. 

### Total number of deaths by district
```{r}
fatalities %>% dplyr::filter(!is.na(DIST_ID)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Tot_Deaths > 1) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x = reorder(DISTRICT, -Tot_Deaths), 
                          Tot_Deaths, fill = "red")) + 
  xlab("District") + ylab("Total number of deaths") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.position = "")
```

It is clear that the maximum number of people died in Sindhupalchok. 

## Total number of injured by District
```{r}
fatalities %>% dplyr::filter(!is.na(DIST_ID)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Total_Injured > 50) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x = reorder(DISTRICT, -Total_Injured), Total_Injured)) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = DISTRICT, Total_Injured, label = Total_Injured), 
            vjust = -0.5, color = "blue") + 
  xlab("District") + ylab("Total number of Injured People") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14))
```

While the total number of people that died in Sindhupalchowk is highest, the 
highest total number of injured people ocurred in Kathmandu. Part of the reason 
that a lot of people got injured in Kathmandu is because the population in Kathmandu 
is very high compared to other districts. Kathmandu is the capital of Nepal and 
according to this dataset we are looking at the total population was 1744240. 

## Total number of government / Public buildings destroyed 
```{r}
fatalities %>% dplyr::filter(!is.na(DIST_ID)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(GovtBuild_Damage > 1, PublicBuild_Damage > 1) %>% 
  dplyr::select(DISTRICT, GovtBuild_Damage, PublicBuild_Damage) %>% 
  tidyr::gather(key = "variable", value = "value", -DISTRICT) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(DISTRICT, -value), y = value, 
                          fill = variable), stat = "identity") + 
  facet_wrap( ~ variable, ncol = 1, scale = "free_y") + 
  xlab("DISTRICT") + ylab("Number of damaged buildings") + labs(fill = "") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust =1), 
        legend.position = "")
```

The earthquake did a lot of damage on government and public buildings throughout 
the country. From this graph, we can see that a lot of public buildings and private 
buildings were damaged in Sindhupalchowk. However, the government buildings damage 
is not proportional to the public building damage in other districts. While lot 
of public buildings got damaged in `Nuwakot` and `Kabrepalanchok` the number of 
government buildings got damaged are pretty low. Most of the public houses that 
got damaged in these districts were old houses. 

# Using wordcloud package to visualize the casualties

Now we are going to look into wordcloud package and plot the districts with higher 
frequency of death, injuries and building damages. 

Let's look at the number of people who died in the earthquake. 

Before looking into the wordcloud, I am going to create a function which we can 
use for all the data columns. The function that I have written takes the words and 
frequencies and then apply color settings to our words when they are displayed. 
In order to be seen on the word cloud I have specified the minimum frequency to be 
5. 

```{r}
# Word cloud
wordcloud_jd <- function(words, freq){
  wordcloud(words = words,max.words = Inf, freq = freq,  
            random.order = FALSE, random.color = FALSE, scale = c(5.,.8 ),
            colors= c("indianred1","indianred2","indianred3","indianred"), 
            res = 300, width = 12, height = 10)
}
```

We will now use the function `wordcloud_jd` to plot total number of people by 
district. 

### Word cloud of total number of people died by district
```{r}
wordcloud_jd(words = fatalities$DISTRICT, freq = fatalities$Tot_Deaths)
```

Looking at the wordcloud, we can see that the maximum number of people died in 
Sindhupalchowk. The second is Kathmandu, and then Nuwakot and so on. That is the 
total number of people died in a district. Now let's examine if the word cloud is 
consistent for male and female deaths. 

```{r}
# Word cloud for deaths by male
wordcloud_jd(words = fatalities$DISTRICT, freq = fatalities$Death_Male)
# Word cloud for deaths by female
wordcloud_jd(words = fatalities$DISTRICT, freq = fatalities$Death_Female)
```

From these wordclouds, we can see that maximum number of male and female that died 
is in Sindhupalchok. However, the second highest death for male occurred in Kathmandu 
while the second higest death for female occurred in Nuwakot district. 

### Word cloud of total number of injured by district

```{r}
wordcloud_jd(words = fatalities$DISTRICT, freq = fatalities$Total_Injured)
```

While the total number of people that died was higher in Sindhupalchowk, the injured 
number was very high in Kathmandu. Sindhupalchowk is the 4th in terms of total 
number of injured people. 

We will look into more details and correlations between variable in future post.
