This is my first blog on data science topics. In this blog post, I will show you 
how to import the data from `fantasy premier league` into R and perform exploratory 
data analysis. 
------------- 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

The questions that came up in my mind before doing this analysis are: 

1. How has Wayne Rooney been performing for the last several years ? 
2. How do Romelu Lukaku, Sergio Aguero, Harry Kane line up side by side ? 

The data sources that we will be using on this tutorial can be found on the following links: 

1. https://fantasy.premierleague.com/drf/elements/
2. https://fantasy.premierleague.com/drf/element-summary/{player_id} 

The second link above requires the user to know the `player_id` in order to access 
the details about the particular player. 

The packages we will need for this analysis are 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(rjson)
library(knitr)
library(plotly)
```

The data available for the link mentioned above is in `json` format. So, we will 
use `rjson` package in order to read and summarize in R. 

## Reading data using rjson package

```{r}
json_file <- "https://fantasy.premierleague.com/drf/elements/"
json_data <- fromJSON(paste(readLines(json_file), collapse = ""))
# View length of json_data
length(json_data)
```

Now, we have read the data into R and `json_data` variable contains list of `566` 
players. 

## Change the data to data frame 

```{r}
players <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, lapply(json_data, rbind)))
# View head
head(players[,c(1:10)])
# Sapply class
sapply(players[,c(1:10)], class)
# Reshape the data frame with only selected columns
players <- players %>% dplyr::select(id, first_name, second_name, total_points, yellow_cards, 
                                     red_cards, goals_scored, assists)
head(players) %>% knitr::kable()
```

## Finding the players whose stats we are interested in 

We need to be very careful with the letter type when searching the players. For example, 
if you search `Alexis Sanchez`, then the program won't find any player with that name. 

```{r}
interested_players <- c("Alexis SÃ¡nchez", "Romelu Lukaku", "Harry Kane", "Wayne Rooney")

players %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(full_name = paste(first_name, second_name)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(full_name %in% interested_players) %>% knitr::kable()
```


# Accessing Stats of individual players

Now that we have found the `id` of interested players, let's go ahead and pull data for 
these players. 

I have created a function in order to pull information for the players 

```{r}
# A function to calculate the statistics of each player 
player_stats <- function(player_id, player_name){
  #browser()
  json_data <- fromJSON(paste(readLines(paste0("https://fantasy.premierleague.com/drf/element-summary/", player_id)), collapse = ""))
  # If we look at the length of json_data, it will be 6 
  # We will be looking at only the first list : past_history
  # Convert json_data to data.frame
  player <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, lapply(json_data[1]$history_past, rbind)))
  # Change each column from list to vector
  player <- tidyr::unnest(player, )
  player$name <- player_name
  return(player)
}
```

In the above function, we are just looking at the first list that contains the 
past history of each player. The following information is available to us if we are interested:

  * The information on lists are summarized below:
  * List 1 : history_past
  * List 2 : fixtures_summary
  * List 3 : explain
  * List 4 : history_summary
  * List 5 : fixtures
  * List 6 : history
  
### Viewing Wayne Rooney's Stats 

```{r}
rooney <- player_stats(player_id = 161, player_name = "Wayne Rooney")
# Look at dimension of rooney
dim(rooney)

# View 6 columns of dataframe
rooney[,1:6]
# Names of columns
names(rooney)
```

### Reshape function 

For this tutorial, we will look at only `goals_scored`, `total_points` and `assists`. 
So, I am going to write another function that selects only these three variables and
change to tidy data. 

```{r}
player_reshape <- function(playerdf){
  playerdf %>% tidyr::gather(key = "variable", value = "value", -id, -season_name, -name) %>% 
    dplyr::filter(variable %in% c("goals_scored", "total_points", "assists"))  
}
```

### Creating data frames for players 

```{r}
rooney_reshape <- player_stats(player_id = 161, player_name = "Wayne Rooney") %>% player_reshape()
sanchez_reshape <- player_stats(player_id = 14, player_name = "Alexis Sanchez") %>% player_reshape()
kane_reshape <- player_stats(player_id = 394, player_name = "Harry Kane") %>% player_reshape()
lukaku_reshape <- player_stats(player_id = 285, player_name = "Romelu Lukaku") %>% player_reshape()
```

#### Combining all the dataframes into one and visualizing

```{r}
all_players <- rbind(rooney_reshape, sanchez_reshape, kane_reshape, lukaku_reshape)
head(all_players)
```

The data is tidy because each observation is shown in each row in the table. 

Now, let us use ggplot to visualize the plots. 

```{r}
ggplot(all_players) + geom_bar(aes(season_name, as.numeric(value), fill = name), 
                               position = "dodge", width = 0.5, stat = "identity") + 
  facet_wrap(~ variable, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") + 
  xlab("Premier League Season") + 
  ylab("Total Fantasy Points / Goals Scored / Assists") + 
  labs(fill = "Players")  + 
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

If you want to view the interactive version of the above graph use the `plotly` package and 
use `ggplotly` function. 

```{r}
library(plotly)
ggplotly(ggplot(all_players) + geom_bar(aes(season_name, as.numeric(value), fill = name), 
                               position = "dodge", width = 0.5, stat = "identity") + 
  facet_wrap(~ variable, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") + 
  xlab("Premier League Season") + 
  ylab("Total Fantasy Points / Goals Scored / Assists") + 
  labs(fill = "Players")  + 
  theme(legend.position = "top"))
```

I hope you guys learned how easy it is to bring the `fantasy premier league` data into R
and then analyse using the awesome packages such as `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2` etc.
